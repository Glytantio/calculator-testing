# Calculator Testing (QA Portfolio Project)

This repository contains manual and automated test cases for verifying the functionality of a basic calculator application.  
It is part of my QA portfolio to demonstrate skills in **test design**, **execution**, **bug reporting**, and (optional) **test automation**.

---

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
The objective of this project is to ensure that the calculator performs arithmetic and special operations correctly, handles edge cases gracefully, and maintains a user-friendly experience.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
- **Manual Testing:** TestRail / Google Sheets / Excel
- **Automation (Optional):** Selenium, Cypress, or Playwright
- **Programming Language:** Python / JavaScript
- **Bug Tracking:** Jira / GitHub Issues

## âœ… Test Scenarios

### Basic Operations
1. Addition of two numbers
2. Subtraction of two numbers
3. Multiplication of two numbers
4. Division of two numbers

### Edge Cases
1. Division by zero
2. Operations with negative numbers
3. Decimal calculations
4. Very large number calculations

### Functional Tests
1. Clear (C/AC) button functionality
2. Chained operations (e.g., `2 + 3 Ã— 4`)
3. Order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS)
4. Continuous operations without pressing equals
