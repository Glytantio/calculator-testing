# Calculator Testing (QA Portfolio Project)

This repository contains manual and automated test cases for verifying the functionality of a basic calculator application.  
It is part of my QA portfolio to demonstrate skills in **test design**, **execution**, **bug reporting**, and (optional) **test automation**.
